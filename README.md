# SBP
Statistical Binary Pattern
This code is developped by Thanh Phuong NGUYEN, U2IS, ENSTA Paristech for the paper "Statistical Binary Patterns" submited to Neurocomputing. It need MathWorks (verfied with MathWorks R2011) environment to excecute.
In order to run the main program (SBP_Outex_HighOrder, SBP_KTH2_HigherOrder_Multiscale), the public texture dataset (Outex, and KTH-TIPS 2b) must be downloaded to corresponding folders: Datasets/Outex/Outex_TC_00010/, Datasets/Outex/Outex_TC_00012and Datasets/KTH-TIPS2-all



In the code we used the existing code avaiallble to public (LBP and CLBP) that can be taken from following address
LBP: http://www.cse.oulu.fi/CMV/Downloads/LBPMatlab
CLBP: http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/code/CLBP.rar

We would like to thank the authors of these above works for sharing code for research purpose.
